# A-Comparative-Study-of-YOLO-Object-Detection-Variants
In computer vision where real-time and object recognition accuracy is important this study systematically and accurately analyzes three major YOLO models such as YOLOv4, YOLOv6, and YOLOv8 analyzes that actively evaluate their performance in terms of accuracy, processing speed and sample size on various datasets and computational resources In addition to paying particular attention to their suitability in specialized areas such as traffic control and medical imaging, the study examines the impact of model upgrades so, and provide valuable insight into the development process of the YOLO model. The results of this study gives as a useful insight for researchers, developers and decision makers to choose the best YOLO model for their specific application.
